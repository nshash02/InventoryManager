### Installation & Setup

The following instructions focus primarily on installation:

* **Prerequisites**:
  - Ensure you have both **MySQL** and **Java** downloaded on your device.
  - Connect the SQL and Java program using a **JDBC driver**. Instructions for this can be found [here](link-to-tutorial).

* **Files**:
  - An SQL script designed to interact with a MySQL database.
  - Four Java classes designed to work collaboratively to instruct the database.

* **Running the Program**:
  - Once the database is running with the script and connected to the Java program, initiate the interaction with the database by running the `InventoryApp.java` class.

### Modification & Contribution

Feel free to modify the program for your personal needs. Comments are placed alongside major methods and processes to aid in understanding.

### Disclaimer

This script is relatively simple in its design and function, with areas of potential improvement. It's recommended for simulated purposes only at this stage.
