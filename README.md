# InventoryManager
An Inventory and Financial Metrics Management System:
Welcome to my inventory management system. The folowing instructions are going to mainly be focused on installation. There are two types of files here: An SQL script designed to interact
with a MySQL database and four java classes designed to work together to instruct the database. Therefore, in order to run the program, you will need both MySQL and Java downloaded on 
your personal device. You will then need to connect the SQL and Java program together using a JDBC driver. Instructions for how to do this can be found online. Once the database is 
running with the script and connected to the Java program, you can interact with the database by running InventoryApp.java class. If you wish to modify the program for your own use, by 
all means do it. I have placed comments next to all major methods and processes to make this easier for you. I would like to put a disclaimer out there that this script is relatively 
simple in design and function. There is also much to add and improve. As such, I do not reccomend using it
